# Contribute

It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

### Writing content

- `README.md` acts as the home page

You can easily update the documentation in `README.md`, of course you can add [more pages](more-pages.md).

### Preview your site

Run the local server with `docsify serve`. You can preview your site in your browser on `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
docsify serve docs
```

?> For more use cases of `docsify-cli`, head over to the [docsify-cli documentation](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify-cli).
